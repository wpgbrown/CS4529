\section{Automation in code review}

\subsection{Testing}
\em{Discuss how testing is often automated, which is often used as one of the needed metrics for code review to be approved (via the "Verified" label on gerrit)}

\subsection{Necessity of human review}
\em{Discuss and debate via providing different sources how relevant and needed human review is compared to automation - Human review is very wide-spread, even if the amount of human review is light.}

\subsection{Automatically recommending code reviewers}
\em{Discuss the previous research and implementation by unreview for gitlab. Try to link speed of code review into automatically recommending reviewers.}

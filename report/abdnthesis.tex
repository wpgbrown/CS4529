%% It is useful to split the document up as chapters and include
%% them.  LaTeX will sort out all the numbering and cross-referencing
%% for you --- if you run it enough times!

%% If you want to include only a couple of chapters then use the
%% \includeonly{} command with a list of the file/chapter names that
%% you wish to include.  NB, this must be in the preamble.

\rcnote{You want the abstract to cover the entire page or be close to it (but do not go over one page).}

  Code review is a critical part of software development which catches bugs and improves the quality of the code. However, identifying appropriate reviewers in a large project with many potential reviewers is a challenge. \rcnote{Talk more about the challenges and why it can be so challenging.}
  
  In this report we implement a rule based and neural network based recommender implementations to automatically recommend reviewers for changes in the open-source project ``MediaWiki''. To make these recommendations a large dataset of items including code review votes, comments and code history is collected and applied to the implementations. \rcnote{Talk more about the approach here.}
  
  The evaluation results suggest that ... %We finally discuss the implications of the evaluation and detail future research opportunities created by this report.
